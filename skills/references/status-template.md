# Hashbuild Status

<!--
  STATUS TEMPLATE — a status report is a concise, at-a-glance snapshot of the
  current .hb workspace. Fill each section from the live filesystem. Use the
  exact step folder name (e.g. `step-1-add-form`) when a step has a flavor;
  plain `step-N` otherwise. Omit the Archive section if there are no archived
  tasks. Omit the Active Tasks section if there are no active tasks.
-->

## Initialization

<!--
  Exactly one of the two lines below. Remove the other.
-->

`.hb/` initialized

`.hb/` not found — run `/hb-init` to set up

---

## Active Tasks

<!--
  One row per active task, in filesystem order (author → task_id).
  "Ticket" shows ✓ if the task has ticket.md, ✗ otherwise (task-level has_ticket).
  Count columns (Skeleton/Ticketed/Planned/Executed/Review open/Reviewed) show — when zero.
  "Total" always shows the raw integer.
  Below each task row, two indented lists are rendered (each omitted when the
  corresponding array is empty):
    - Needs review — step folder names from steps_needs_review
    - Needs work   — step folder names from steps_needs_work
-->

| Task                     | Ticket | Skeleton | Ticketed | Planned | Executed | Review open | Reviewed | Total |
| ------------------------ | ------ | -------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| `<author>/<task_folder>` | ✓/✗   | `<—/n>`  | `<—/n>`  | `<—/n>` | `<—/n>`  | `<—/n>`     | `<—/n>`  | `<n>` |

  - **Needs review:** `<step-folder>`, …
  - **Needs work:** `<step-folder>`, …

## Archive

|                |           |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Archived tasks | `<count>` |

- `<author>/<task_folder>`

<!--
  Recent: up to 5 most-recently-archived entries from archive.recent, each as
  author/task_folder. Omit the section entirely when archive.recent is empty.
-->

## Next Action

<!--
  One concise sentence or bullet telling the user what to do next.

  Decision tree (pick the first that applies):
  - .hb not initialized (ie does not exist) → run /hb-init
  - any active task with no ticket.md → add ticket.md to it with Background and Acceptance Criteria (summarize ticket-template.md and present to user)
  - any active task with ticket.md but no steps or no steps that have ticket.md → /hb-task-plan or /hb-task-step-add with manually created tickets (summarize ticket-template.md and present to user) or manually add ticket.md to existing steps
  - any active task has a step with no ticket.md → run /hb-task-step-add or
    write ticket.md for that step
  - any active task has a step with ticket.md but no plan.md → run
    /hb-task-step-plan for that step
  - any active task has a step with plan.md but no execution-*.md → run
    /hb-task-step-execute for that step
  - all steps of an active task have executions → consider archiving with
    /hb-task-archive or adding the next step with /hb-task-step-add or /hb-task-plan
  - no active tasks → start a new task with /hb-task-create
